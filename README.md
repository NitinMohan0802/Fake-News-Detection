# Fake-News-Detection
Fake News Detection
Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect fake news. Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and logistic regression, the model can classify news articles as real or fake. The project involves several key steps, from data collection and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

Usage
Step 1: Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-detection.git
cd fake-news-detection
Step 2: Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages:

sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 3: Setup Kaggle API
To download the dataset, you need to set up the Kaggle API:

Place your kaggle.json file (which contains your Kaggle API credentials) in the root directory of the project.

Run the following commands to configure Kaggle:

sh
Copy code
pip install kaggle
mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
cp kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/
chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
kaggle competitions download -c fake-news
unzip fake-news.zip
Step 4: Data Preprocessing
The dataset is loaded and preprocessed using pandas and NLTK. The preprocessing steps include:

Loading Data: The dataset is read into a pandas DataFrame.
Handling Missing Values: Any missing values in the dataset are filled with empty strings.
Text Cleaning and Stemming: The text data is cleaned by removing non-alphabetic characters, converting to lowercase, and stemming the words.
Feature Extraction: The content of the articles is combined into a single feature and transformed into numerical vectors using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
Step 5: Model Training
The preprocessed data is split into training and testing sets. The logistic regression model is then trained on the training data:

Splitting Data: The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
Training the Model: A logistic regression model is trained using the training data.
Step 6: Model Evaluation
After training, the model is evaluated on both the training and testing sets to determine its accuracy:

Training Accuracy: The model's performance is measured on the training data.
Testing Accuracy: The model's performance is measured on the testing data to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.
Step 7: Making Predictions
The trained model can then be used to make predictions on new data. For example, given a new piece of news, the model can classify it as either real or fake.

Implementation Details
Data Preprocessing
Stopwords Removal: Commonly used words (stopwords) that do not contribute much to the meaning are removed.
Stemming: Words are reduced to their root form to standardize and reduce the complexity of the data.
Feature Extraction with TF-IDF
TF-IDF is used to convert the textual data into numerical vectors that the logistic regression model can understand. TF-IDF measures the importance of a word in a document relative to its occurrence in the entire dataset.

Model Training with Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a simple yet effective linear model for binary classification problems. It predicts the probability that a given input belongs to a certain class (real or fake news).

Evaluation Metrics
The primary metric used to evaluate the model is accuracy, which measures the proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total instances.

Conclusion
This Fake News Detection project provides a practical implementation of machine learning techniques to tackle the problem of misinformation. By following the steps outlined, you can preprocess data, train a model, and make predictions on news articles. The use of TF-IDF and logistic regression ensures that the model is both interpretable and effective for binary classification tasks.
